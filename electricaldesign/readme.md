#Proposal for the Powersupply

In order to work good with the Robot,
As a developer I need a to connect the Robot to a 230V or a battery.

Siedconditions:
* switsche from battery to mains voltage when the 230V supply is conected
* has till now two different currentlevels 
  * approximal 15 V for Arduino and elkrticaldrive
  * approximal 5 V for everithing with USB PI
* overall energy comsumption is not clear has to be investigated
