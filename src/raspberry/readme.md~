There is a image located on a server 
**Promissed to do this**

If you want to do this by your sefl or want to know what we did just look here:

Testing the first listener

precondition:
Runnuing Roscore

To start Arduino serial:
rosrun rosserial_python serial_node.py /dev/ttyACM0

nice to have/see:
rostopic echo /robotron --> when the app is started
rostopic list

when you will connect from a different PC use:
export ROS_MASTER_URI://raspberrypi:11311
